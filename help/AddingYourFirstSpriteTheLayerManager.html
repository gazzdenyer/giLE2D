  	    Well then, its time that we set up our map layers so that we can 
		organize our sprites better.<br />
		<br />
		Layers are good because they allow us to code for groups of sprites that 
		do the same thing (e.g. ground sprites, collectables, etc) and it also 
		allows us to control the Z-Order in which they are rendered.<br />
		<br />
		With AGK as an example, it supports almost 10,000 layers. That means 
		that sprite 1 can be behind sprite 2, which can be behind sprite 3, etc, 
		etc.<br />
		<br />
		Although its not necessary to to so in <strong>giLE2D</strong>, its 
		always great practice to define to yourself what types of objects are 
		going to appear in your map up-front, before creating anything.<br />
		<br />
		With this in mind, lets have a look at <strong>giLE2D's</strong> Layer 
		Manager.</td>

				<td style="width: 255px">
				<img alt="layer manager" height="726" longdesc="layer manager" src="images/layer_manager.png" width="247" /></td>
				<td valign="top">First, click the "layer Manager" tab, as shown 
				on the image to the left here.<br />
				<br />
				You will see a toolbar with four buttons on it, and a 
				white-space which will show the list of layers that you have 
				created/will create. The image on the left is a representation 
				of "<em>here's one I did earlier...</em>"<br />
				<br />
				Lets say, for the sake of protracted gibbering, we want to have 
				five layers in our map, because we have five discreet types of 
				sprite that we want to have.<br />
				<br />
				These discreet types are:<br />
				<br />
				Map Geometry<br />
				Liquids<br />
				Collectables<br />
				Player (most important!)<br />
				SpringBoard<br />
				<br />
				When we go to actually add a sprite to the map, we are going to 
				first select the sprite type (see<a href="AddingYourFirstSpriteSpriteTypes.html" target="_blank"> 
				here</a>), and then choose the layer that the sprite belongs to.<br />
				<br />
				Anyway, before we get ahead of ourselves, lets add a layer.<br />
				<br />
				1. Click the "Add Layer" button
				<img alt="layer add" height="25" longdesc="layer add" src="images/layer_add.png" width="29" /><br />
				2. An "Add Layer" dialog will appear for you.<br />
				<br />
				<img alt="layer_add_dialog" height="179" longdesc="layer_add_dialog" src="images/layer_add_dialog.png" width="411" /><br />
				<br />
				3. Fill in the name of the layer you wish to create (in this 
				case, "map Geometry").<br />
				4. Click OK... the layer will now appear in the layer manager 
				list for you to use.<br />
				5. Repeat steps 1 - 4 for each of the other types (Liquids, 
				Collectables,Player, SpringBoard)<br />
				6. Note that each layer is given an ID that you can manipulate 
				in your game code.</td>

  	    So, now we have our map layers.<br />

		Note that we can also delete layers
		<img alt="layer delete" height="25" longdesc="layer delete" src="images/layer_delete.png" width="29" /> 
		or even change their order
		<img alt="layer order" height="25" longdesc="layer order" src="images/layer_order.png" width="63" /><br />
		<br />
		Deleting layers has a number of considerations that need to be looked 
		at, especially when you already have a bunch of sprites in your map that 
		belong to the layer that you wish to delete. However, that is a topic 
		for <a href="DeletingLayers.html" target="_blank">later discussion</a>.</td>
