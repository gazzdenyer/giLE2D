  	    If you read the previous help item, <strong>
		<a href="MediaAndYourAGKProject.html">Media And Your AGK Project</a></strong>, 
		you will have seen how easy it is to import stuff into giLE2D. However, 
		there are some constraints with automatic importing, the main one being 
		that you can only drag and drop image files whose dimensions (x-size and 
		y-size) are a power of 2!</td>

  	    Why is this, you may ask... and you may... but most game engines out 
		there are generally happier if image dimensions are a power of two... 
		its got something to do with the way the engines calculate stuff.</td>

  	    By ensuring the texture dimensions are a power of two, the graphics 
		pipeline can take advantage of optimizations related to efficiencies in 
		working with powers of two. For example, it can be (and absolutely was 
		several years back before we had dedicated GPUs and extremely clever 
		optimizing compilers) faster to divide and multiply by powers of two. 
		Working in powers of two also simplified operations within the pipeline, 
		such as computation and usage of mipmaps (a number that is a power of 
		two will always divide evenly in half, which means you don't have to 
		deal with scenarios where you must round your mipmap dimensions up or 
		down).</td>

  	    OK then, the next thing I should tell you about would be getting an
