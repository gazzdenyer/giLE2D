  	    OK, in this section, we are going to learn how to add backdrops to your 
		map.<br />
		Since there are two types of map by default that we can create, static 
		and scrolling, we will pick the more involved backdrop, which is 
		scrolling. But first a note on static maps.<br />
		<br />
		<em>A static map will generally have only one backdrop. Therefore, if 
		you pick this option when you create your map (see </em>
		<a href="createamap.html" target="_blank"><em>Creating Your First Map</em></a><em>) 
		then the Back Drop dialog, pictured below, will only have the first slot 
		open. This does not mean to say that you are limited, though. It 
		entirely depends on how you code your game.<br />
		You could have chosen the scrolling map option when creating your map, 
		but your game code dictates entirely how you utilize these resources!</em><br />
		<br />
		Anyway, go ahead and create a scrolling map (if you have not done so 
		already). <br />
		As you know, giLE2D comes with some cheap artwork! So, for this example, 
		I'm going to use it!<br />
		Now, with infinite enthusiasm... do the following.<br />
		<br />
		1. Click on the "Back Drops" button, shown below. The "Edit/Change Back 
		Drop Files" dialog will appear to you.</td>

		<td class="auto-style3" style="height: 22px">
  	    In this dialog below, you will see four slots. giLE2D supports up to 
		four layered backdrops for your maps. The key here is to already have 
		your backdrop files ready.<br />
		In this example, I am only going to use three backdrop files, since the 
		scroller framework suppied with giLE2D is coded for only three. But, as 
		usual, you are free to modify this code for your own devices!<br />
		<br />
		Anyway, I recommend that you start with the background file (like a sky, 
		etc... something thats going to look like its in the far distance).</td>

		case, I am using a nice space themed PNG file called "back1.png".<br />
		<br />
		<em>NOTE: It is necessary for these files to be 1136 pixels in width, so 
		that the image can be repeated correctly by the framework code. Again, 
		you can always code this to your liking, but for the example framework, 
		make sure it is 1136px wide. A netter explanation of this is given </em>

		length of tiling the images across the repeater multiplier that you 
		chose when <a href="createamap.html" target="_blank">creating your map</a>. 
		It keeps things less complicated resource wise.<br />
		When you get to the point of actually running the map in the example 
		framework supplies, you will see the backdrops scrolling by at different 
		rates, all correctly tiled and repeated. This is <strong><em>parallax 
		scrolling</em></strong> at work!</td>
