		</span><br class="auto-style7" />
		<span class="auto-style7"><a name="1136x640"></a>After extensive testing on various devices, I 
		have found that a map resolution of 1136 x 640 (<em>aspect ratio 1.775, 
		16:9</em>) creates the best results. AGK uses a system called<em><strong> 
		virtual resolution</strong></em>, which brilliantly adapts to each 
		device (even on a Windows PC!). To read more, you can review the AGK 
		command</span> <span class="auto-style6">
		<a href="http://www.appgamekit.com/documentation/Reference/Core/SetVirtualResolution.htm" target="_blank">
		setVirtualResolution</a></span> <span class="auto-style7">on AGK's 
		website. This is why giLE2D only supports one resolution so far (don't 
		worry... more are planned as a free upgrade to registered users!).<br />
		<br />
		Also, it is necessary for you to have previously created an AGK project, 
		complete with its <em><strong>/media</strong></em> folder. gilE2D will 
		look for this when you create your maps, since it needs to know what 
		media to load for your project. An example of a typical AGK project file 
		structure can be seen below:</span></td>

  	  <strong>Right, lets dig in!</strong><br />
		<br />
		OK, to create a new map, we must first click on the "<em>New Map</em>" 
		button in giLE2D's main toolbar.<br />
		When you do this, the following dialog will appear:</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="auto-style5">
  	  &nbsp;</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="auto-style2">

	<tr>
		<td class="auto-style5">
  	  &nbsp;</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="auto-style5">
  	  <span class="auto-style7">You'll notice that the active field in the 
		dialog is the "<em>Map Name</em>" field. It is <strong><em>HIGHLY 
		RECOMMENDED</em></strong> that you name your maps thusly:</span><br class="auto-style7" />
		<br class="auto-style7" />
		<span class="auto-style9"><em><strong>map1</strong></em></span><em><strong><br class="auto-style9" />
		</strong></em><span class="auto-style9"><em><strong>map2</strong></em></span><em><strong><br class="auto-style9" />
		</strong></em><span class="auto-style9"><em><strong>map3</strong></em></span><br class="auto-style7" />
		<span class="auto-style7">... and so on...</span><br class="auto-style7" />
		<br class="auto-style7" />
		<span class="auto-style7">Later, when you come to write a parser or, 
		maybe, even use my parsing example, you'll see that this will give you a 
		nice natural order.</span><br class="auto-style7" />
		<br class="auto-style7" />
		<span class="auto-style7">Anyway, or as my <strong>
		<a href="http://www.thegamecreators.com" target="_blank">TGC</a></strong> 
		pals might say... "any road-up", in the "<em>Map Name</em>" field, type 
		"<strong><em>map1</em></strong>"<br />
		<br />
		Now then, you'll notice that the "<em>AGK Project Media Folder</em>" 
		field has a nice little navigation button with two folders at the end of 
		it that you can click, instead of typing in the full path to your AGK 
		projects media folder. Clicking this button gives you the following 
		standard Windows <em>choose folder</em> dialog.</span></td>

	<tr>
		<td class="auto-style5">
  	    <span class="auto-style7">Now, if you noticed, there is also a group box 
		on this dialog, titled "<em>Map Type</em>". <strong>giLE2D</strong> 
		makes provision for non-scrolling and scrolling type games. If you 
		choose the non-scrolling option, <strong>giLE2D</strong> will create a 
		map with a resolution of 1136 x 640. However, if you choose the 
		scrolling option, you will be asked to supply a "<em>Repeat Multiplier</em>" 
		value. This tells <strong>giLE2D</strong> how many times to repeat the 
		backdrops of a map in the X-Plane (X-direction). </span>
		<br class="auto-style7" />
		<br class="auto-style7" />
		<span class="auto-style7">For example, our base resolution is 1136x640. 
		So the maximum x value of the map is 1136 for a static, non-scrolling 
		map before we hit the edge of the screen. However, for a scroller, we do 
		not want to hit this limit, so the repeat multiplier tells <strong>
		giLE2D</strong> how much to extend the x-plane. </span>
		<br class="auto-style7" />
		<br class="auto-style7" />
		<span class="auto-style7">So, if you were to choose a repeat value of 3, 
		the map dimensions would be (1136*3)x640, or 3048x640. This extends the 
		map beyond the screen and, using some code in AGK, allows the creation 
		of a scrolling map. We have supplied basic framework AGK Basic code for 
		a parallax scrolling game and we highly recommend you look at the code 
		to see how it all works!<br />
		<br />
		For the time being, just select the non-scrolling option to get started. 
		We will discuss scrollers later.</span></td>

  	  Now you can click the OK button. Incidentally, there's nothing to stop you 
		typing in the path... if it doesn't exist then giLE2D will tell you, and 
		then you'll get frustrated. Honest. I don't care really! If typing stuff 
		is your M.O. then more power to ya!<br />
		<br />
		So, after you click OK, giLE2D will attempt to check the validity of the 
		claims you made in the fields above. It will look to see that a real AGK 
		project exists in the location you specified. If it can't validate that 
		a real AGK project is there, it'll complain (and maybe cry some). No 
		harm no foul, just fill in the correct stuff and giLE2D will create your 
		new map project!<br />
