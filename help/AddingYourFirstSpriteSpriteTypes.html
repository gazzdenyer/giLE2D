  	    Alrighty then, its high time we start getting some stuff into our map... 
		isn't it... or is it?<br />
		First, I'd really like to tell you about Sprite Types. Its kinda 
		important.<br />
		If you take a look near the top left of <strong>giLE2D</strong>, you 
		will see a drop down called "Sprite Type To Create". This is important 
		and somewhat cool.</td>

  	    We can see from this list that there are nine pre-defined sprite types 
		that are incorporated into <strong>giLE2D</strong>. Later on, we will 
		discover that we can create an ENORMOUS number of different sprite 
		types, by adjusting the 31 properties that each sprite has, but for now, 
		this helps us quickly add sprites with pre-defined properties. This 
		really helps speed map development up!<br />
		<br />
		Anyway, I will list each pre-defined sprite type, and tell you just 
		exactly what the definition of each type is...</td>

  	    When we eventually go to add a sprite to the map, we will pick one of 
		these pre-defined sprite types. It will help us to quickly create our 
		prototypes.<br />
		<strong>But</strong>, there is another thing that we need to be aware of 
		before adding sprites... and that is the use of <strong>LAYERS</strong>.<br />
		Layers will allow us to code for stuff like "<em>should the player pass 
		in front of, or behind this doo-hickey..</em>." type thing.<br />
		<br />
		Layers allow us to control the rendering, or "Z-Order" of the sprites. 
		It also allows us to group like-sprites together!</td>
