  	    Lets start with an example.<br />
		<br />
		I want my player to be able to stand on something. Something that isn't 
		going to scratch, deface, disembowel, or kill him/her/it. (we need to 
		include "it" here so as to not offend game characters of a neutral 
		disposition).<br />
		<br />
		Well then, what am I to do?<br />
		<br />
		To me, this sounds like a piece of map geometry that we wany to add 
		(player can stand on it, doesn't hurt him/her/it), etc.<br />
		OK, lets set it up!<br />
		<br />
		First, with your nice, new map opened in <strong>giLE2D</strong>, do the 
		following:</td>

  	    1. Make sure you have selected the "Media" tab in the <strong>giLE2D</strong> 
		browser. Also make sure you have the "Available Sprites" tab selected. 
		Look at the image below... its shows you.</td>

		supplied with <strong>giLE2D</strong>, I have found a sprite image that 
		will stand in nicely for some sort of Map Geometry block (a platform, 
		the ground, etc). It is called "dirtMid.png", and it is going to be the
