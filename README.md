This project is an oldie! It was meant to compliment "The Game Creators" product called AGK (app game kit), which is a development framework for mobile games.
The Game Creators can be found at https://www.thegamecreators.com/ and the AGK framework at https://www.appgamekit.com/
Since there was no simple 2D map/level editor around at the time, I decided to develop my own editor.
This project was never completed and, as such, is published as learning code only.
I believe there is now a full-fledged editor included with the product.
Feel free to use the code.

There are some dependencies. I relied heavily on TMS libraries for Delphi.
At the time of writing (10/14/2024), I tested the project with Delphi 12.2 Athens. In your dev environment, you must have TMS VCL UI Pack 13.1.0.1 library installed (trial is fine).
You can obtain this library at https://www.tmssoftware.com/site/tmsvcluipack.asp

Anyway, feel free to re-use the code and have fun!
P.S. I am not open for questions regarding the source. It is an old, but working (kinda) project.
Enjoy!
