BUG  (RESOLVED)
----
Add sprite from list (default type, default layer).
Move sprite.
Click manage Layers, choose a layer.
Click Show All Layers... the newly added sprite reverts to its original position


CAUSE
------
Bug is being caused by reading FMapStringList, whick is not updated after moving the sprite


SOLUTION
----------
When a sprite is moved, its new position has to be updated in the internal FMapStringList.
This should probably be on the TMover.ControlMouseUp method.
// NEED code here to update the sprite position in FMapStringList
  TGazzMap.CreateFileContents(self, FMapStringList, MapBackground); // this should do it ???





BUG  (RE-OPENED)
----
When in clone mode, addig a sprite does not increase FileID property (FSpriteCount)


CAUSE
------
FSpriteCount is not being incremented and assigned to the clone


SOLUTION
---------
Increase FSpriteCount in clone mode. Make sure its assigned to TSpriteBlock.FIleID





POTENTIAL BUG (RESOLVED)
---------------

Allow saving when only partial layers shown? (may only save the visible layer!!!)

Make sure all layers are loaded before save.
